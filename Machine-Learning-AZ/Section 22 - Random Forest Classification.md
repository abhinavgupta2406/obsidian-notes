Ensemble learning is when you take multiple ML algorithms and put them together to create one bigger ML algorithm, so this ML algorithm is leveraging many other ML algorithms.

So Random Forest methods combines many decision tress methods. Instead of running Decision tree method once, we will run multiple times.
